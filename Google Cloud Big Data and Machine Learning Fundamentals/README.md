## Module 3 Resources

This module is on performing **product recommendations using Cloud SQL and Apache Spark**. 

We'll cover product recommendations, which is probably the most common machine learning problem employed by businesses. Along the way, we'll also get to look at two **Google Cloud products; Cloud SQL, which is a managed relational database, and Cloud Dataproc, which is a managed environment on which you can run Apache Spark.**
